// Screen Utility /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We're basically refactoring our test to make it more resilient to changes that the code base may experience over 
// time. Now, if we add another button, it doesn't really matter because as long as the user is still able to find the 
// decrement button by its name and the fact that it's actually a button, our test will as well.

// The user is going to find this message by seeing the text "Current count,‚Äù then a number. We can do the same thing
// here by saying, our message is screen.getByText, and we'll say current count.

// We're going to get the element that has the text "Current count." That's going to be our message element. Then we 
// no longer need that container at all and we can just say, "Hey, render this to the page," then my screen will be 
// responsible for grabbing things on the page.

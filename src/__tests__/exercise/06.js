// Mock Geolocation /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// The first thing that I want to do is render this location component, so I'm going to come down here and say render
// location. Then, we're going to do a screen.debug to get an idea of what happens when we do that.

// First of all, we had to mock out the geolocation API because that's not currently supported in JS DOM. Even if it
// were, we might want to mock out what getCurrentPosition returns, so that our tests will run reliably, regardless of
// where the machine is in the world at the time that's running our test.

// We mock it out to a Jest mock function. Down here, we create a fakePosition and we make a mock implementation
// getCurrentPosition to call the callback with that fakePosition.

// But then we only want to do that after this promise resolves, which will give us a chance to verify that the
// loading spinner shows up before we tell that promise to resolve, wait for it to resolve, and then verify the UI
// after that state.

// Act Function /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Now that we've got a passing test, we've got an error right here saying, "Hey, you've got an update into location
// that wasn't wrapped in act." What in the world is this? You can dive in and read about this. I linked to a blog
// post in the instructions.

// Now, act() is a function that's built in to react-test-utils. React Testing Library re-exports it right here.
// We can pull that act utility out. Then we're going to wrap this inside of act. We'll say act. This is an
// asynchronous thing that's happening. We're going to make our callback async and we're going to wait for this whole
// thing to finish.

// Now, what this is going to do is it's going to say, "OK, I'm going to go ahead and do all the things which it will
// include calling this callback. Once this whole thing resolves, then I'll go ahead and flush all of the side effects
// that happened during that time." We can save this. We get rid of that warning and are interacting with a stable UI,
// just like the user would in a real application.

// This is one of the very few places where you actually need to use act directly. Most of the API's that you use
// within React Testing Library are going to handle this for you automatically. You don't normally need to deal with
// act directly.

// In situations like this where we are directly calling a function that results in calling a state update or function,
// we do have to use act ourselves.
